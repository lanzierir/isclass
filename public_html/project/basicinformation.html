                                                                                                              <p>There are many types of vegetarians. Some eat dairy foods, such as cheese or eggs, while others avoid entirely any food product that comes from an animal.</p>
        <p>A <em>lacto-ovo vegetarian</em>, for example, consumes milk and dairy foods, eggs, grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds, but avoids meat, fish and poultry. A <em>lacto-vegetarian</em> follows a similar diet, but does not eat eggs. Meanwhile, a <em>vegan</em> stays away from animal-based products entirely, which, in addition to meat, also includes milk and dairy products, lard, gelatin and foods with ingredients from animal sources. Some vegans also do not eat honey.</p>
        <p>People choose vegetarian diets for many reasons, including personal preference, health concerns, distaste for meat or other food from animals, or they believe a plant-based diet is healthier.</p>
        <p>Some adopt a vegetarian lifestyle for ethical reasons. Many vegetarians, for example, avoid meat because they do not want animals killed or harmed. These individuals may object to the treatment of animals raised on industrial farms assumed to be in terrible conditions.</p>
        <p>The environment is an additional concern for some vegetarians. Animal by-product is said to be just as not if worse for the environment as carbon emissions. Other examples are animal waste from factory farms polluting the land and water or forests that are cut down to make room for grazing cattle.</p>
        <p>Many people make the switch to a vegetarian diet because of the potential health benefits. Vegetarian eating patterns have been associated with improved health outcomes including lower levels of obesity, a reduced risk of heart disease and lower blood pressure. Also, vegetarians tend to consume a lower proportion of calories from fat and fewer overall calories, and more fiber, potassium and vitamin C than non-vegetarians. These characteristics, plus lifestyle factors, may contribute to the health benefits among vegetarians.</p>
